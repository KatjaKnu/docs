// TODO This text assumes that browser callable endpoints have already been explained earlier.

If you are building your user interface with Hilla, you use reactive endpoints to push messages from the server to the browser. A reactive endpoint is an endpoint that returns a `Flux` from https://projectreactor.io/[Reactor]. For example, an endpoint that emits the current date and time every second could look like this:

[source,java]
----
@BrowserCallable
public class TimeEndpoint {

    @AnonymousAllowed
    public Flux<@Nonnull String> getClock() {
        return Flux.interval(Duration.ofSeconds(1)) // <1>
                .onBackpressureDrop() // <2>
                .map(_interval -> Instant.now().toString()); // <3>
    }
}
----
<1> Emit a new message every second.
<2> Drop any messages that for some reason cannot be sent to the client in time.
<3> Output the current date and time as a string.

Hilla generates the necessary TypeScript types to subscribe to this endpoint from the browser.
