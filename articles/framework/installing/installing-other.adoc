= Installing Other Tools

We recommend using a browser with either integrated or external development tools.

At least Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome have an integrated web inspector, which supports inspecting the DOM structure of a web page, as well as CSS styles and debug JavaScript execution. The feature sets of the integrated tools are extensive and additional ones are usually not needed.
